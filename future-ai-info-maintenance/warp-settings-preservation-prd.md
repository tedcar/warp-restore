# Warp Terminal Settings Preservation - Product Requirements Document

**Shell Environment: BASH PRIMARY** - System designed with bash as the main shell environment, with fish as secondary support.

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Users lose all custom configurations, themes, MCP server setups, and preferences when creating new Warp accounts or switching between accounts on Arch Linux. This forces manual reconfiguration of complex setups, significantly impacting productivity and user experience.

### Solution Overview
Develop a comprehensive settings preservation system that automatically backs up and restores Warp configurations across account changes, with special focus on MCP server configurations and UI/theme settings.

### Success Metrics
- Zero manual reconfiguration required for new accounts
- 100% preservation of MCP server configurations
- 100% preservation of themes and UI settings
- Sub-30-second restore time for complete configuration

## 2. Problem Analysis

### Current Pain Points

#### 2.1 Settings Loss Scenarios
1. **New Account Creation**: All local settings overridden by empty cloud settings
2. **Account Switching**: Previous account settings not accessible
3. **MCP Server Loss**: Complex MCP configurations must be manually recreated
4. **Theme Reset**: Custom themes and UI preferences lost
5. **Rules and Preferences**: Custom rules and workflow configurations lost

#### 2.2 Root Causes
- **Cloud-First Architecture**: Warp prioritizes cloud-synced settings over local storage
- **Account-Tied Configuration**: Settings are bound to specific account identities
- **Incomplete Settings Sync**: MCP servers and custom themes not included in Warp's Settings Sync
- **Override Behavior**: New accounts start with empty configurations that override local settings

#### 2.3 Current Workarounds
- Stay logged out (limits collaboration features)
- Manual backup/restore of configuration files (error-prone)
- Avoid account switching (limits flexibility)

### Impact Assessment
- **Productivity Loss**: 30-60 minutes per account switch for reconfiguration
- **Error Prone**: Manual MCP server recreation leads to configuration errors
- **User Frustration**: Repeated loss of carefully crafted setups
- **Feature Avoidance**: Users avoid Warp's collaboration features to preserve settings

- **Backup Orchestrator**: Coordinates backup operations
- **Data Extractor**: Extracts settings from various sources
- **Integrity Checker**: Verifies backup completeness

#### Restore Engine
- **Conflict Resolver**: Handles setting conflicts
- **Selective Restorer**: Restores specific configuration categories
- **Database Manager**: Safely modifies SQLite database
- **Validation Engine**: Ensures restore success

#### Configuration Manager
- **Settings Parser**: Understands Warp configuration formats

- **Account Adapter**: Adapts settings to new account contexts

### 4.2 Data Flow

```
1. Pre-Account Operation
   ├── Detect account operation trigger
   ├── Create backup snapshot
   ├── Verify backup integrity
   └── Allow operation to proceed

2. Post-Account Operation
   ├── Detect new account context
   ├── Analyze current vs backup settings
   ├── Perform selective restore
   ├── Validate restored configuration
   └── Report status to user
```

### 4.3 Storage Strategy

#### Backup Location
- Primary: `~/.warp-settings-backup/`
- Structure: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/` timestamped directories
- Retention: Keep last 10 backups, auto-cleanup older ones

#### Backup Contents
```
backup-timestamp/
├── user_preferences.json
├── warp.sqlite.backup
├── mcp/
│   ├── server_configs.json
│   ├── environment_vars.json
│   └── logs/
├── themes/
├── settings.dat
└── metadata.json
```
